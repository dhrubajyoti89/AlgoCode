# Description

An integer number in base 10 which is divisible by sum of it digits is said to be a Harshad Number. An n-harshad number is an integer number divisible by sum of its digit in base n.
Below are first few Harshad Numbers represented in base 10:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 20………

Given a number in base 10, our task is to check if it is a Harshad Number or not.

# Algorithm

1. Extract all the digits from the number using % operator and calculate the sum.
2. Check if the number is divisible by sum.

# Examples

- Input: 3
  - Output: 3 is a Harshad Number

- Input: 18
  - Output: 18 is a Harshad Number

- Input: 15
  - Output: 15 is not a Harshad Number
