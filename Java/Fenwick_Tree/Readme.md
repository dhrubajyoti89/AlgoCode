# Problem Statement
 A Fenwick tree or binary indexed tree is a data structure providing efficient methods for calculation and manipulation of the prefix sums of a table of values.
 
### Representation
Binary Indexed Tree is represented as an array. Let the array be BITree[]. Each node of the Binary Indexed Tree stores the sum of some elements of the input array
