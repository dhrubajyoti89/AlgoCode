# Problem Statement
Given two arrays A1 and A2; Find the Minimum and Maximum Scalar product of these two arrays.
A scalar product is also known as the dot product of two vectors.

For finding the minimum scalar product of arrays we need to multiply the minimum value of array to the maximum value of the second array and add all multiple values.

Hint: here we need to sort the array1 and array2 in ascending order and descending order respectively.
For finding the maximum scalar product of arrays we need to multiply the minimum value of array to the minimum value of the second array and add these multiple values.

Hint: Here we need to sort the array1 and array2 in ascending order and ascending order respectively.

## Code

## Sample Input
Enter no. of elements you want in array: 4
Array 1 : 1 2 3 4
Array 2 : 5 3 2 1

## Sample Output
Minimum Scalar Product is 21
Maximum Scalar Product is 34
