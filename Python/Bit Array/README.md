Hello I am [Heisenamphetamine](https://github.com/Heisenamphetamine) and I have contributed to this file.

This code returns the number of distinct array a which is generated from the following pseudo code:

```
a[0] = S (modulo 2^31)
for i = 1 to N-1
    a[i] = a[i-1]*P+Q (modulo 2^31) 
```
    
### Example

Input: 3 1 1 1 <br>
Output: 3
