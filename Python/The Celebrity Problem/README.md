### The Celebrity Problem
In a party of N people, only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present in the party, 
if yes, (s)he doesn’t know anyone in the party. We can only ask questions like “does A know B? “.

### Example<br>
Input<br>
0 0 1 0<br>
0 0 1 0<br>
0 0 0 0<br>
0 0 1 0<br>

Output<br>
id : 2<br>

Explanation: The person with ID 2 does not<br>
know anyone but everyone knows him
