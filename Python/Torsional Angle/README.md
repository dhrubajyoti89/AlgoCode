### Finding Torsional Angle 

* Code will take 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate for point A B C D and will 
  return angle between the plane made by the points A,B,C and B,C,D in degrees.

### run the script ?

* run the command : python3 main.py.
* enter the input Coordinates of A B C D respectively.
* the ouput is the angle between planes between them in degrees.

### Example

Input:<br>
0 4 5<br>
1 7 6<br>
0 5 9<br>
1 7 2

Output:
8.19
