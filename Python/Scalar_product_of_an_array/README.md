### How to use

You can run the script like this:

```bash
python3 scalar_product.py 3,1,4,2 5,1,3,2
```

The first and the second argument are two comma-separated arrays of numbers (either ints or floats). The script then calculates the minimum and the maximum scalar product 
between the two given 1D arrays.
