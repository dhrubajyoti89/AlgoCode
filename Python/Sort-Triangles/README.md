# Sort Triangles

## Instructions
The code is simple, all you need to do is run SortTriangles.py and follow the instructions on the command prompt.

### How it will run
1. User will be asked to enter how many triangles will be sorted
2. User will be asked for the 3 sides of each triangle (integers only)
3. Once the above is entered code will sort them and print the sides in ascending order based on their areas
    1. Area is calculated using Heron's formula
