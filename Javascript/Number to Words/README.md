This Code takes in Numbers as Input
Such as: 100 or 10000

The Program transforms the User Input to Words. Like:

Sample Input: 100
Sample Output: One Hundred

Sample Input: 1982
Sample Output: One Thousand Nine Hundred and Eighty Two

This Uses RegEx and converts the Number to Words in Indian Number System.
(That is, it has Lakhs and Crores instead of Millions and Billions and their conversion is different too).
