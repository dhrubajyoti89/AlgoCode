# Problem Statement
Given two arrays A1 and A2; Find the Minimum and Maximum Scalar product of these two arrays.
A scalar product is also known as the dot product of two vectors.

### Example
- #### Input: 
    - Array 1 : 1 2 3 4
    - Array 2 : 5 3 2 1

- #### Output:
    -  21

- #### Explanation: Scalar Product: (1 . 5) + (2 . 3) + (3 . 2) + (4 . 1) = 5+6+6+4 = 21
