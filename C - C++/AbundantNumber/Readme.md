# Problem Statement
A number n is said to be Abundant Number to follow these condition:-
- The sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number         itself.
- And the difference between these two values is called the abundance.
- Example:- Abundant number 12 having a proper divisor is   1,2,3,4,6 the sum of these factors is 16 it is greater than 12 so it is an Abundant number.
Some other abundant numbers
18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 96, 100, 102, 104, 108, 112, 114, 120..

### Example
- #### Input: 18
- #### Output: 18 is an Abundant Number !!
- #### Explanation: Divisor of 18 = 1,2,3,6,9 and sum of divisors = 1+2+3+6+9 = 21 which is greater than 18
