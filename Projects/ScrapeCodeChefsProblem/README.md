# Scrape CodeChef's Problems

This project scrapes CodeChef's Problems Description according to the Problem Code given by a user and saves all the important information in a text file.

## Getting started

To get started, install the required packages present in `requirements.txt`:

	$ pip install -r requirements.txt

And everything is ready to start scrapping your problems:

	$ python main.py PROBLEM_CODE

Once the program's done running, you will find a file named `PROBLEM_CODE.txt` in the program's directory with all the desired information.
###### Important Note: This tutorial assumes that the user has already installed Python 3 and added it to the PATH.
